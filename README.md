# Description:
  This project was developed as a part of a homework assignment where we were asked to create a note taking application that can be used to write, save, and delete notes. This was achieve by using express backend. 

# Installation Instructions:
  First we copied the source code provided to us and maintained the folder structure. 
  Then we installed all the modules and packages like so. 
  ```
  npm i
  ```
  Doing so will give us all of the node modules and packages.json files. 

  After the application is created we will deploy it on heroku. 
  For this follow the following steps inside your terminal to make sure you have access to your heroku account.
  ```
  heroku login
  ```
  To ensure you login into your heroku account.
  ```
  heroku create
  ```
  To create an open application that will be deployed on your heroku dashboard. 

  Check for remote repositories by 
  ```
  git remote -v
  ```
  Once app is created and renamed you need to ensure you rename it on the terminal and update the remote repo link as follows:
  ```
  heroku git:remote -a"<new name>"
  ```
